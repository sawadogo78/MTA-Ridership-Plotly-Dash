As a Data Visualization Specialist for the Data & Analytics Team at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), I am tasked with analyzing post-pandemic ridership recovery trends across the North America's largest transportation network. <br> 
The COVID-19 pandemic drastically impacted public transit, causing significant declines in ridership due to health concerns and remote work shifts. <br> I use Pandas, Numpy, Plotly and Dash to uncover insights, creating an interactive dashboard that illustrates post-pandemic ridership volume and recovery rate trends across the MTA's services. <br><br>

About the Dataset: <br>
The daily ridership dataset provides systemwide ridership and traffic estimates for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (MTA) different services beginning March 1st, 2020, and provides a percentage comparison against pre-pandemic figures.
